### AGORA

trip to agora (buying, selling)
last bolt of cloth has been sold, have to track the new owner down, haggle
get distracted by mates hanging out in Perfume Shop, choice to spend 30 mins chatting with them or not
go to altar of eponymous heroes, read notices of what's happening in courts in future
window-shopping
kerfuffle - slave running away from master, running to shrine to seek sanctuary. Do you block slave (get reward) or let him reach shrine (people get angry)?
Buy temple offerings
Blacksmith stall (buy mattock)
Sell things (eg honey if you remembered to bring it with you) - spend time doing it yourself, or give to friend and collect money later (he takes a cut)

### TEMPLE OF HEPHAESTION
Make an offering (trade item eg. votive object / food for energy). Bigger offering = more energy.

### ACROPOLIS
Make an offering (trade item eg. votive object / food for energy). Bigger offering = more energy.
Look at looted spoils (spend time, get patriotic, gain energy)

### THEATRE OF DIONYSUS

### ASSEMBLY (PNYX)

### COURTS
Sit on a jury to make money (need jury token) - lose time but gain energy and money

### TAVERN



### TRACKING

- inventory
- time
- money
- main objectives
- optional / bonus objectives
- hunger (if it goes below certain level, you get energy penalty, and ultimately you faint)
- energy (higher energy = speed bonus, faster journey times) - engaging in public life / religion makes you feel like a good citizen, therefore more energy



### STUFF TO PROGRAM
- 50/50 chances (eg of getting distracted in Stoa - get held up/get energised)
- info boxes which can pop up when a frame is processed (eg with historical info)


### DOG
- When on road you encounter a dog, you have the option to throw stones / give pat / ignore. If you throw stones, it bites your leg and you lose speed/time. If you pat, it follows you into Athens. You meet a farmer who has lost his dog, if you have the dog, he gives you some food (loaf of bread).
